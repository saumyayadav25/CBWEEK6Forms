        <p>It’s well-known that dogs are man’s best friend, but they do much more than just hang out with us. Dogs provide emotional support when we are stressed or anxious and are highly attentive to us and our emotional states.</p>
        <p>Dogs provide non-judgmental support in a unique way. They have also been found to reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol, lower perceived stress in individuals, improve mood, and improve energy up to 10 hours after interactions. Therapy dogs are prevalent on many college campuses now due to these impacts and are found in hospitals for the same reasons, having been found to reduce subjective pain, increase good hormones and dampen bad ones, causing some patients to require less pain medications.</p>
        <p>Along with reduced stress, dogs make us healthier in other ways, from making us exercise to reducing risk of cardiovascular disease. A study of 424 heart attack survivors found that non-dog owners were four times more likely to be deceased one year after the attack than victims who owned dogs.</p>

        <h4> International Dog Day</h4>
        <p>Since 2004, we celebrate August 26 as International Dog Day. It is dedicated to dogs who, unlike humans, never betray us or play with our feelings. They are quick to understand our emotions. Whenever we feel sad or bad, a dog will surely come and lick us or sit on our lap to comfort us and show their love for us.</p>
